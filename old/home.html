The Department started in 1985 with only one teacher at the Reader Level.
<p>
In 1986, a one year PGDCSA (Post Graduate Diploma in Computer Science and Application) was started with 30 seats (At that time only a few Institutes in India had Post Graduate programs in Computer Science). 12 batches of student completed the PGDCSA  course till 1999.
<p>
In January 2001, the Department  started a two year M. Sc. program in Computer Science.
<p>
In 2004 the Department started M. Sc. in IT along with the existing M Sc. in CS.
<p>
The Department has state-of-the-art Computing facilities and all Machines are connected to LAN and leased line Internet.
