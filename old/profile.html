<legend class="blue">A Brief Profile of the Department</legend>

<p>
The Department was established in 1985. The Department began by introducing a one-year Post Graduate Diploma in Computer Science and Application in 1986. In 2001, a two -year (four-semester) M. Sc Programme in Computer Science was introduced after obtaining approval from the UGC, replacing the PGDCSA programme. The Department started a second M. Sc programme in Information Technology in 2004. In this year the department is going to start a four year B.Tech (CSE) program. 
<p>
Current research activities in the Department include Algorithms, Data mining, Computer Networks, Mobile Computing, Artificial Immune systems and Computational Linguistics. 
<p>
Programmes offered:
<ol>
<li>	2-year M. Sc. in Computer Science (Intake: Maximum 15)</li>
<li>	2-year M. Sc. in Information Technology (Intake: 30 (minimum 15))</li>
<li>	Ph.D programme</li>
</ol>
<p>
Eligibility for M.Sc (CS/IT) Courses:
<p>
Candidates satisfying any one of the following qualifications or equivalent qualifications:
<ul>
<li> B. Sc with Computer Science as the Major subject
<li> B. Sc. with Computer Science as a general subject up to the third year
<li> B.C.A. 
<li> B.E./B. Tech. (CSE/IT)
<li> P.G.D.C.S.A or equivalent with B.Sc.
</ul>
<p>
Candidates must have Mathematics as a subject/paper at both the TDC and 10+2 levels. The minimum percentage of marks required at the TDC level is 45% in aggregate (in the Major course only for candidates having Major in Computer Science). For candidates having P.G.D.C.S.A., the minimum requirement is 45% in aggregate at the degree examination and P.G.D.C.S.A. individually. 

<p>
There will be a common admission test for all consisting of two papers in Computer Science. One paper will be on Fundamentals and General Awareness of short answer-type. The other paper will be of an advanced level, and the course content for this paper will be the TDC general course in Computer Science of Gauhati University. The final selection of candidates will be made on the basis of the admission test. The Department will adopt a cut-off mark in the admission test for the screening of candidates for admission 

<p>
Course structure of the M. Sc. Programme:
<ol>
<li>Semester - 1<br>
	Five core papers with 6 credit points each.
<li>Semester – 2<br> 
	Five core papers with 6 credit points each.
<li>Semester – 3<br>
	Four core papers with 6 credit points each and one elective paper. 
<li>Semester – 4<br>
	Two elective papers and a Project of 18 credits.
</ol>

<p>Lab Facilities:
<p>
The department has a Computing Laboratory with twenty nine desktop computers connected to the Internet and two high-performance multi-purpose servers via a high-performance computer network and related accessories. The Computing Laboratory has a LAN Trainer Kit, Dot Matrix Printers, High speed scanners for the students and Laser Printers / Inkjet printers for official use.
<p>
One Hardware Lab and one Embedded System Lab are presently under construction and are likely to provide state-of-the art computing facilities in the respective fields very soon.
<p>
Departmental Library:
The department has a well-furnished library-cum-reading-cum-conference room with more than two thousand books.
<p>
Technology/Science oriented Research in the Department:
<ol>
<li>Three major research projects are ongoing with Dr. Shikhar Kr. Sarma as the Chief Investigator:
<ol>
<li>NE Language Technology Development Project: Sponsored by Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, Govt. of India (Total Project value: 1.52 crores): This project aims at developing the standards, technologies, tools and applications for putting  Assamese and Bodo languages in the Digital Media as equivalent to another language like English. The scope includes developing Unicode Compliances for both the languages, ground work building for local language Operating Systems, building complete digital script grammars, spell checker design and development, and building a large corpus in Unicode format.
<li>Development of NE Wordnet: Sponsored by Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, Govt. of India (Total Project value: 32 Lacs): This project aims at developing Digital Wordnets in Assamese and Bodo Languages. The Wordnets in Assamese and Bodo Language will then be integrated with the other Wordnets like Hindi and English, which will eventually form the background of efficient local language search engines etc.
<li> Design and Development of a Digital Assamese Thesaurus: Sponsored by UGC (Total Project value: 9.26 lacs): This project will output a structured digital Assamese Thesaurus which will be integrated with an interface enabling cross lingual information retrieval more efficient and meaningful.
</ol>
<li>One major research project is ongoing with Mr. Abhijit Sarma as the Chief Investigator:
<ol>
<li>Development of framework for logging and analysis of Network Traffic to secure Network Infrastructure: Sponsored by Department of Information Technology, Govt. of India (Total Project value: 46 lacs).
</ol>
</ol>
<p>
Linkage with Industry/Science based research labs:
<p>
The Department has research collaboration with following national R&D organizations and Institutions:
<ol>
<li> Collaboration with C-DAC Pune for the NE Language Technology Development Project for joint research, technology and tool transfer, training etc.
<li> The NE Wordnet Project is in a joint consortium mode, where IIT Bombay is the consortium leader. 
</ol>
<p>Placement Profile:
<p>
Some of the organizations where our students got placements include Xcome Technology, Taipei, Taiwan; Start Technologies, Taiwan; Versine Technologies, Kolkata; CDAC, Bangalore; Maharastra Knowledge Corporation Ltd; Web Tech India, Bangalore; AMTRON, Guwahati; Wipro Systems; NIIT Bangaloire; Maverik Systems, Chennai, etc. Besides students passed out from this department are now engaged in teaching positions in various educational institutions within and outside  the state of Assam.
<p>
Achievement of the Department in the field of Technology/Science:
<p>
